=============================================

I'll flesh out this README later, but for now, it's pretty limited. This is my CMS
which was a pet project from a few years ago that I've decided to start development
on again. My first order of business is a big backend rewrite to encompass all the
new knowledge I've gained since the original codebase was created. Then, I'll work
on the interface aspect which could also use some touching up. The Microsoft icons
will be the first to go :)

If you want to install this on your own server, copy all the files over and
navigate to /system/install.php in a browser. The rest should be self-explanatory
but feel free to send me an email if you need help!

For the next few weeks at least I should be pumping out updates pretty frequently
as I want to rewrite and retheme a lot of this to make it more presentable. If
you install a copy, check back here often for new improvements! If I change
data structure at all I'll include upgrade scripts from here on out.

If you want to try out a live demo, check out

Post whatever you like; it's a sandbox that gets reset decently often anyway.
