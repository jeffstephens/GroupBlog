=============================================

I'll flesh out this README later, but for now, it's pretty limited. This is my CMS which was a pet
project from a few years ago that I've decided to start development on again. My first order of
business is a big backend rewrite to encompass all the new knowledge I've gained since the
original codebase was created. Then, I'll work on the interface aspect which could also use some
touching up. The Microsoft icons will be the first to go :)
