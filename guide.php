<h1>Getting Started with the Family Website</h1>
<div class="green">
<p>This is version 2.0 of the family website. Some of you may remember using the old family site. You may also remember how it failed after a few weeks of good use. This site is a revamp of the old one. It has the same core feature, the News Blog.</p>
<p>A main goal of mine in creating this site was for it to be simplistic and highly functional. I wanted it to be easy to use while powerful. I think I achieved this fairly well, as you'll soon be able to see.</p>
</div>

<h2>What's New?</h2>
<div class="green">
<p>The main problem with the old site was that there wasn't that much activity by design. Logically, people didn't visit it very often for this reason. The way I'm fixing this problem is to have the site notify you when there is activity. It sends out an email to everyone when a new blog post is added, for example. This way, you can come back only when you know there's something new to read. Of course, this email notification is optional.</p>
</div>

<h2>If You Didn't Use the Old Family Site</h2>
<div class="green">
<p>Then you're in for a nice surprise. This site offers a great place for everyone in the family to share recent goings-on, make announcements, and plan get-togethers. Everyone can see it any time they like. Everyone can contribute, and everyone else can read and discuss those contributions.</p>
<p>When we just can't get together to talk face-to-face, this is the next-best option. I think after using it a while, you'll agree with me.</p>
